			You may be wondering why we made h2 italic using the font-style property instead of using tags like we did in a previous lesson. There are a few reasons for this. First, we can modify the tag just like any other HTML tag.  stands for emphasize, and eventually, we may decide that we want to emphasize text by bolding it instead of italicizing it, which we may not want for our h2s. Second, one of the advantages of CSS is that we can change style in many places at the same time. What happens when we add another h2? We have to adds again so that it has the same formatting. Say we want our h2s to be bold as well. Now we have to add <strong>tags</strong> We end up repeating ourselves with many opportunities to miss something. By using CSS, we only need to change the style in one place, and every <h2> on every page that uses that CSS file will be updated.</h2>
